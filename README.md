# Joe's Student Drinking App  

### At some times in our lives we want to balance taste & brand with alcohol content.  

### At other times we want to manage alcohol intake, because we know exactly how we want to feel.

It would be so handy if we knew how much alcohol was in a drink. It could also help to know how much that alcohol costs, and whether that is economic sense.  
A ready reckoner to compare how much alcohol is in a drink would be useful too - so when you are drinking something less familiar, you still have some idea of what might be an appropriate amount for you to drink.

This app provides all of that. Compare what you buy to a standard pint of beer - 3.8% - and see the comparison in pint icons.  
Input drinks and see them saved to your device along with the analysis of alcohol units and price per unit.
