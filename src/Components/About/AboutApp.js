        <p>
            This app allows you to quickly find out how many units of alcohol a
            drink contains, and also what kind of alcohol value for money this
            gives.

            much they cost ..."
        </p>
        <p>
            Just input volume, price and alcohol percentage, and the app does the
            rest. It also stores your queries, so you can refer back and compare.
            And you can filter and sort your items - so you can compare deals and
            off-brand offerings.

        <p className="quote"> ... value for money is important ... </p>

            biggest bang for your buck.

        <p>
            But alcohol is a poison. It is not good for you and can easily harm you.
            See below for more information. This app enables you to see how many
            units of alcohol you may be consuming and how this compares to what is
            safe.

        <p className="quote">
            "... see how many units of alcohol you may be consuming and how this
            compares to what is safe..."
        </p>
        <p>
            Be in control of what you drink: Work out how many units gets you feeling how you want to feel and then
            work out how much of any given drink will do that. Don't listen to others - listen to yourself.
